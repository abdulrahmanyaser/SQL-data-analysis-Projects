# Customer Analysis
#### in this dashboard i used real records of almost 300k of records to analyse and understand how the sales and reviews performance is going on 
##### so here's the analysis steps i did :
###### 1- check the revenue per month/age/state 
###### 2- comparing between each region revenue percentage
###### 3- comparing between males and females revenue for each category
###### 4- finding the correlation between the quantity and discount percentage
